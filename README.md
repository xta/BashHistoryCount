# Bash History Count
## by @rexfeng 2012

A simple ruby script that looks through ~500 lines of your ~/.bash_history file. Counts occurrences of Bash commands and puts results in desc order.

# possible uses of this:
* stats of bash commands over time (requires backing up .bash_history over time)
* advice on what shortcuts to implement in .bash_profile based on what commands you enter too much
